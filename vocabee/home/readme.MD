# vocabee/home

This folder contains the static files, templates, views and models. Why this required another separate folder is due to 
the way blueprints are structure in Flask. This is essentially its own "app". 
[See this](https://exploreflask.com/en/latest/blueprints.html#how-do-you-use-them) for reference.
