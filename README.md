# VocaBee
 
This is the home repository of the website code of VocaBee. VocaBee is a Japanese language vocabulary tool, meant to provide a modern solution to learning vocabulary for newer students. See the website at [vocabee.xyz](https://www.vocabee.xyz)!

# Technology stack

The application is written in Python with the Flask framework. All data is stored and processed using PostgreSQL and its respective tools. Front-end has been done with Jinja2, plain Javascript and SASS.

# Data

Original vocabulary and example sentence data is sourced from [Tanos.co.uk](http://www.tanos.co.uk). While the site is nearing antique at this point, its datasets are gigantic and solidly written. The data has been collected with a Python webscrapere which you can find in [this repository](https://github.com/MichaelVerdegaal/tanos_scraper)
